                To show elevation gain in activities, the extension needs to ask Strava for the elevation data for the
                activity. Your permission is needed for this so please sign in to Strava. This only gives the extension
                permission to request data for <em>your</em> activities so you will not be able to see the cumulative elevation
                data for someone else's activities. You will, however, be able to see the elevation gain on any public
                route.
